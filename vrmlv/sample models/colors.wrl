#
#  This world is simply used as something colorful.  Orientation interpolators
#  slowly spin 9 frames, each with a slightly different speed.  At first
#  there is a clear structure, but as the animation evolves the structure
#  dissolves in to chaos.  If you wait long enough, they'll all get back in
#  sync again... after about 560 years!
#
#  Things to experiment with:
#        Try using other time keyValue for the rotation speed of the 9 squares.
#        If the keyValue are multiples of a common factor, the squares will
#        get in sync sooner than if they don't have a common factor.
