#  Robot Transform
#  robobill.wrl
#        by David R. Nadeau
#
#  This example illustrates the use of Group, Transform, and Transform groups.
#
#  A robot is built with its head in a Transform group, but its torso
#  left out of it.  As the viewer walks about the robot, the head always
#  turns (about the Y axis) to face the viewer.
#
#  To make it clear what is, and is not moving to track the viewer, the
#  torso of the robot remains fixed, as does a background of blue slabs.
#
#  Things to experiment with:
#        Place the entire robot in the Transform group so that the whole
#        robot tracks the viewer, not just the robot's head.
#
#        Add textures to the environment.
#
#        Add light sources, such as one placed in the lower ball of the
#        robot.  Make that ball emissive as well so that it looks like the
#        ball is the source of light.  Remember to put the light source
#        inside the robot's transform group so that as the robot moves,
#        the light source moves with it.
#
#        Add behavior to the robot.  Make it move on its own!
#
#        Place the robot in to a separate VRML file and inline it in to
#        this, and other environments.
